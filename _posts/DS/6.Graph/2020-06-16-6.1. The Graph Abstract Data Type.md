## The Graph Abstract Data Type (Chapter 6.1)

### 6.1.1 Introduction

- The Königsberg bridge problem
  
  
  
  - In the town of Königsberg, four land areas divided by the river Pregel are interconnected by seven bridges.
  - The problem is to determine whether, starting at one land area, it is possible to walk across all the bridges exactly once in returning to the starting land area.
  - In 1736, Leonhard Euler used the concept of a graph to address this problem.
  
- An example walk in the town of Königsberg
  - start from area B $\rightarrow$ walk across bridge a to area A $\rightarrow$ take bridge e to area D $\rightarrow$ take bridge g to C $\rightarrow$ take bridge d to A $\rightarrow$ take bridge b to B $\rightarrow$ take bridge f to D
  - This walk does not go across all bridges exactly once, nor does it return to the starting point.
  
-  Euler's solution
  - We can draw a graph which consists of vertices and edges.
  - Each land area will become a vertex in the graph.
  - Each bridge will become an edge that connects vertices corresponding to the land areas it interconnects.
  - We define the degree of a vertex to be the number of edges incident to it.
  - Then, there is a walk starting at any vertex, going through each edge exactly once and terminating at the start vertex iff the degree of each vertex is even. 
  - Since the degree of each vertex is not even in the Könisberg example, we cannot find the walk in this problem.

- Applications of graphs

  – analysis of electrical circuits / – finding shortest routes / – project planning

  – identification of chemical compounds / – statistical mechanics / – genetics

  – cybernetics / – linguistics / – social sciences / – etc.

  – A graph is one of the most widely used data structures



### 6.1.2 Definitions

- A graph G consists of two sets, V and E.
- V is a finite, nonempty set of vertices. 
- E is a set of pairs of vertices; these pairs are called edges. 
-  (G) and E(G) represent the sets of vertices and edges of G.

-  We often use G=(V, E) to represent a graph.

- In an undirected graph the pair of vertices representing any edge is unordered.
  - The pairs (u, v) and (v, u) represent the same edge.
- In a directed graph, each edge is represented by a directed pair <u, v>; u is the tail and v the head of the edge. A directed graph is also called a digraph. 
  - The pairs <u, v> and <v, u> represent two different edges.

- G1 and G2 are undirected graphs / G3 is a directed graph.

- Set representation of the sets

  - V(G1) = {0,1,2,3}; E(G1) = {(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)}

  - V(G2) = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}; E(G2) = {(0,1),(0,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,5),(2,6)}

  - V(G3) = {0,1,2}; E(G3) = {<0,1>,<1,0>,<1,2>}

- Restrictions on graphs

  - A graph may not have an edge from a vertex, v, back to itself.

    - (v, v) and <v, v> are not legal.
    - Such edges are called self edges or self loops.
    - Graphs permitting self loops are called a graph with self loops. 

  - A graph may not have multiple occurrences of the same edge.

    - A graph allowing multiple edges between a pair of nodes is called a multigraph. 

    - A graph that does not allow multiple edges between a pair of nodes is called a simple graph to distinguish it from a multigraph.

- The maximum number of edges in any n-vertex undirected graph:  
  - Number of distinct unordered pairs (u, v).
- If a graph with n vertices has exactly n(n-1)/2 edges, the graph is called a complete graph.

-  If (u, v) is an edge in E(G), we say the vertices u and v are adjacent, and the edge (u, v) is incident on vertices u and v.

-  For a directed edge <u, v>, we say u is adjacent to v, and v is adjacent from u. 
   -  <u, v> is incident to u and v.

- A subgraph of G is a graph G' such that and .

- A path from vertex u to vertex v in graph G is a sequence of vertices u, i1, i2,..., ik, v such that (u, i1), (i1, i2), ..., (ik, v) are edges in E(G)
- If G' is directed, then the path consists of <u, i1>, <i1, i2>, ..., <ik, v> in E(G').
- The length of a path is the number of edges on it.
- An example path from 0 to 3: (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (0, 3).
  - The length of the path is 4.
- (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) is not a path from 0 to 3 because (2, 3) is not in E(G).

- A simple path is a path in which all vertices except possibly the first and the last are distinct.
  - (0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3) is a simple path from vertex 0 to vertex 3.
  - (0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 0) is a simple path from vertex 0 to vertex 0.
  - (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (0, 3) is not a simple path because vertex 0 is visited multiple times.
- A cycle is a simple path in which the first and last vertices are the same.
  - (0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 0) is a cycle.

-  In an undirected graph G, two vertices u and v in V(G) are said to be connected $\iff$ there is a path in G from u to v.

-  An undirected graph is said to be connected $\iff$ for every pair of distinct vertices u and v in V(G) is connected.
   -  <img width="337" alt="image-20210923184150676" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135758459-2c14bdd8-4338-4565-9e70-0cd654ea547e.png">



-  A connected component H of an undirected graph G is a maximal connected subgraph.
   -  By maximal, we mean that G contains no other subgraph that is both connected and properly contains H.

-  A tree is a connected acyclic graph.
   -  Acyclic means the graph has no cycles.

- A directed graph G is said to be strongly connected $\iff$ for every pair of distinct vertices u and v in V(G), there is a directed path from u to v and also from v to u. G3 is not strongly connected, as there is no path from vertex 2 to 1.

-  A strongly connected component is a maximal subgraph that is strongly connected. G3 has two strongly connected components.

- The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to that vertex.
  -  The degree of vertex 0 in G1 is 3.

-  If G is a directed graph, we define the in-degree of a vertex v to be the number of edges for which v is the head. The out-degree is defined to be the number of edges for which v is the tail.
   - Vertex 1 of G3 has in-degree 1, out-degree 2, and degree 3.
-  If di is the degree of vertex i in a graph G with n vertices and e edges, then $e = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{d_i}}{2}$

- assume the gramp is an undirected graph.

### 6.1.3 Graph Representations

- The two most commly used representations 
  - adjacency matrix 
  - adjacency list

- Choice of a particular representation will depend upon the application

#### 6.1.3.1 Adjacency Matrix

- The adjacency matrix of $G=(V,E)$ is a two dimensional nxn array, a, with the property that $a[i][j] = 1$ $\iff$ the edge $(i, j)$ is in $E(G)$.
  - $a[i][j] $= 0 if $(i, j)$ is not in $E(G).$
  - For a digraph, a[i][j] = 1 if <i, j> is in E(G).
- For a undirected graph, the adjacency matrix is symmetric.
- For a digraph, the adjacency matrix may not be symmetric.

-  Space needed to represent a graph: n^2 bits.
-  For an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex i is equal to its row sum:
-  For a directed graph, the row sum is the out-degree, and the column sum is the in-degree.

-  If we want to answer questions about a graph such as:
   -  How many edges are there in G?
   -  Is G connected?
-  An adjacency matrix requires O(n2) time.
   -  This may be inefficient when number of edges is small. (The graph is sparse.)



#### 6.1.3.2 Adjacency Lists

- In an adjacency list, the n rows of the adjacency matrix are represented as n chains (or sequential lists).
  - One chain for each vertex in G
  - Nodes in chain i represent the vertices that are adjacent from vertex i. 
    - The vertices in each chain are not required to be ordered.
  - An array adjLists is used so that we can access the adjacency list for any vertex in O(1) time.
    - adjList[i] is the pointer to the first node in the adjacency list for vertex i.

- For a graph with n vertices and e edges, the linked adjacency list representation requires an array of size n and 2e chain nodes.

- In order to answer questions such as 
  - How many edges are there in G? 
  - Is G connected?
- An adjacency list requires O(n+e) time.
- If e is much smaller than n2, then using adjacency list can be more efficient than using an adjacency matrix.



#### 6.1.3.4 Weighted Edges

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135760851-43e029f5-2bad-493d-a686-e7050608d1dd.png)

- In many applications, the edges of a graph have weights assigned to them.
- These weights may represent the distance from one vertex to another or the cost of going from one vertex to another.
- In an adjacency matrix, a[i][j] will now be the edge weight.
- In an adjacency list, the list nodes should have an additional field, weight.
- A graph with weighted edges is called a network.
