## Strings (Chapter 2.7)

### 2.7.1 ADT Strings

<script src="https://gist.github.com/underthelights/63bd8ae579587d167def274566c83519.js"></script>


### 2.7.2 Strings in C - Representation

- In C, strings are represented as character arrays terminated with the null character.

- Example

```c
#define MAX_SIZE 100
char s[MAX_SIZE] = "dog";
char t[MAX_SIZE] = "house";
```

- Internal representation in C

<img width="338" alt="image-20211003143908910" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751703-279339f6-c668-4478-876d-91980769d529.png">

- Alternative declaration
  - If the character array variable is initialized at the time of declaration, we do not need to specify the array size.

```c
char s[] = "dog";
char t[] = "house";
char u[];   // compile error!
```

- If no initialization is done, we need to specify the array size, or we get a compile error.


 - Contenating two strings
   - You can use strcat(s, t), which adds string t at the end of string s. The result is stored in s.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h> // need to include this in order to use string functions.
# define MAX_SIZE 100
void main() {
  char s[MAX_SIZE] = "dog";
  char t[MAX_SIZE] = "house";
  printf("%s\n", s);
  printf("%s\n", t);
  strcat(s, t);
  printf("%s\n", s);
}
```

#### [ex013]

- You should be careful when using functions such as strcat.
- What is the problem with the following code?
  - (For brevity, the following code does not show #include statements.)

```c
void main() {
  char s[] = "dog";
  char t[] = "house";
  char u[] = "rainbow";
  printf("%s\n", s);
  printf("%s\n", t);
  printf("%s\n\n", u);
  strcat(s, u);
  printf("%s\n", s);
  printf("%s\n", t);
}
```

- How can you modify the code to remove the problem?
  - Try using dynamic memory allocation to allocate just enough amount of memory.
  - Beware that a string has a null character at the end.

  

#### String insertion

- Suppose we want to implement a function that inserts a string in between another string.

  <img width="338" alt="image-20211003144036070" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751705-ec15156c-1232-403b-aebd-da3777c821df.png">

- We want to insert t to s at the position after 'a', so that the resulting string is "automobile".

- Function prototype

```c
/* insert string t into string s at position i*/
void strnins(char *s, char *t, int i);
```

##### String insertion: design

- We will use a temp string, and library functions such as strncpy and strcat to implement this function
- strncpy(temp, s, i): copy i bytes from string s to string temp.

<img width="395" alt="image-20211003144145691" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751707-e91b1217-88b6-4c50-a821-79c884735025.png">

#### [ex014]

- This function implementation has a potential problem. Can you identify the problem and fix it?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/underthelights/338f492772c96d4f56c462e0825cdf01.js"></script>

#### [ex015]

- In the problem of pattern matching, we check whether a string pattern appear inside a string.

  - Does the pattern "ello" exist in the string "hello, world!"? YES
  - Does the pattern "abab" exist in the string "abbabba"? NO


- A library function strstr implements this operation.

  - t = strstr(string, pat)
  - if pat is not in string, a null pointer is returned.
  - if pat is in the string, a pointer to the start of pat in string is returned.

### 2.7.3 Pattern Matching

- Let us assume there was not strstr function provided by the library, and we need to make our own function.

- A simple matching algorithm

  -  At each position i of string, check if pat is equal to string[i] ~ string[i+strlen(pat)-1]
  -  strlen: a library function that returns number of characters in the given string.

  

- In the worst case, which is when pat is not in string, the algorithm will have a time complexity of O(nm), where n is the length of pat and m is the length of string.



- Slight improvements

  -  Quitting when strlen(pat) is greater than the number of remaining characters in the string.

  -  Checking the first and last characters of pat before checking the remaining characters.

<img width="395" alt="image-20211003144337055" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751708-4473cd0d-f95c-4302-a98f-25f2f675519d.png">

#### [ex016]

<script src="https://gist.github.com/underthelights/d99045420751a658299a3b16fc5a9490.js"></script>


- Analysis of function nfind
  - For string = "aa...a" and pat = "aa...ab", the computing time is $O(m)$.

  -  But for string = "aa...a" and pat = "aa...aba", the computing time is still $O(nm)$.

### KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm

- KMP algorithm: A better algorithm for finding a pattern in a string.

- Idea: When a mismatch occurs, use our knowledge of the characters in the pattern and the position in the pattern where the mismatch occurred, to determine where we should continue the search.
- We want to search the string for the pattern **without moving backwards** in the string.

- Consider the following example.

```
String: A B C F A B C D A B F A B C D A B C D A B D E
Pattern: A B C D A B D
```

- Before looking at the KMP algorithm, we will see how the "naive" algorithm finds the pattern in the string.
  - The "naive" algorithm is the one we've looked at.
  - It has the time complexity of O(mn) where m is len(string) and n is len(pattern).

  
  
  ```
  String: A B C F A B C D A B F A B C D A B C D A B D E
  Pattern: A B C D A B D
  ```

#### Naive algorithm

- It will start from the beginning of the string and iterate through the string, looking for the pattern. We will call this the outer iteration. (Blue arrow)
- For each starting position of string, it will iterate through the string and the pattern until there is a mismatch of a full match has been found. We will call this the inner iteration. (Green arrow)

<img width="410" alt="image-20211003141915378" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751741-6ebae69f-593e-4e4a-a3fc-d16388caae39.png">

- The first inner iteration ends when a mismatch is found at the fourth character.

<img width="391" alt="image-20211003141934058" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751742-fab567f2-948d-41f6-bed3-89d4ab811a75.png">

- Once the inner iteration ends, we move on to the next outer iteration.
- The inner iteration begins again.
- This time, the first character is a mismatch, so the inner iteration ends there.

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003141950876" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751743-c96fcf44-f71f-4fb2-82e1-078139082e70.png">

- We move on to the next outer iteration... and so on.

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142017765" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751745-43005bac-974e-4bb6-9d69-6d1a4b4a85c8.png">

- When the starting position is the fifth character, the string matches the pattern until the last character, which is a mismatch.

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142032488" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751746-28bcc872-4c3d-43df-ab32-8ef78a890d3d.png">

- When the starting position is 15, we find a match. Then, the program terminates.
- We can see that in the worst case, we need to compare characters for:
  - number of outer iterations x number of inner iterations

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142102365" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751748-7492651f-81b8-4c0e-bb7b-d13ae0d0264a.png">

- The following case shows an example of almost the worst case.
  - For each outer iteration, we need to compare 5 characters until we find a mismatch.
  - Time complexity: $O(mn)$

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142125299" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751750-0507b642-ccb7-462e-9f80-4d700d6b617b.png">

#### Can we do better?

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142140561" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751753-49e3bf1b-6a8b-4429-9aa2-7170baa858a6.png">

- Suppose we have done the first iteration.

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142147609" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751834-f1102e5f-cab2-4762-a96d-da0680d34a2a.png">

- Do we need to move the blue arrow just one position and restart search from there?

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142202790" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751836-3cebbe5a-6e03-4578-9ba5-1a78cab705bd.png">

- Can't we just move to the position where the mismatch occurred?

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142214668" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751838-592961a6-272e-4845-832c-42f1b4cd41c5.png">

- In this case, moving to the fourth position is possible. Why?
- It is because the starting character 'A' does not appear in the pattern ('ABC') after the first character.



- Let's look at the next case where the search begins at position 5 of the string. There was a mismatch at the last character of the pattern.

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142305793" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751839-bc234e32-cd68-46f5-aa51-17772e9b3522.png">

- In this case, can we skip the characters and move to the position where mismatch has occurred?

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142316117" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751842-88f945ec-dbf5-45b3-84d2-9c3c61517d4e.png">

- No! we must consider the possibility that there is a pattern match that starts from position 9, because the character at position 9 is an 'A'.

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142329938" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751844-fdf54f5e-e738-4222-80fd-f2e9a04d3028.png">

- No! we must consider the possibility that there is a pattern match that starts from position 9, because the character at position 9 is an 'A'.

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142336752" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751845-b825a5d4-33ae-4bca-9329-f832dd73c8e5.png">

- But that means we are moving the pointer backwards, and we don't want to do this!
- Can we avoid moving the green arrow backwards?

- Suppose we know that if we start searching from position 9, the first two characters match the pattern.
- Then, we do not need to compare these two characters, and we can start from the position where the green arrow was already at!

<img width="402" alt="image-20211003142401145" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751848-6c90e0a6-f3d4-4c67-bc69-c625b6b07911.png">

- So how do we know that if we start searching from a certain position, the first few characters already match the pattern?
- Let's look at the pattern.

![image-20211003142418081](/Users/kyuhwanshim/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20211003142418081.png)

- In the previous iteration, suppose we had a match in the first three characters, and the fourth character was a mismatch.

![image-20211003142425846](/Users/kyuhwanshim/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20211003142425846.png)

- Then, we know that we can just move three places for the next outer iteration, because the **first part of the pattern is not repeated in the searched pattern**.

- Now, suppose we had a match in the first six characters, and the seventh character was a mismatch.

![image-20211003142449251](/Users/kyuhwanshim/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20211003142449251.png)

- Then, we know that the last two letters are the first part of the pattern.
  - We say the prefix two letters and the suffix two letters match. 

![image-20211003142515534](/Users/kyuhwanshim/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20211003142515534.png)

- In this case, the search should start from the character A, but we do not need to compare the first two characters because they are already a match.



- We can find out where to begin the next search and how many characters are already matched by analyzing the pattern itself.
- We calculate what we call a "failure function" or a "partial match function" which is basically a number of each index of the pattern. We will denote this index as T\[ \].
- The value of the first index is -1. This means that when the search finds a match up to this letter, there is no partial match to be considered in the next iteration.

<img width="251" alt="image-20211003142418081" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751867-daf4765a-c544-4449-bc2b-7cdd9ef14da1.png">

- We start an iteration from j=1 to j<n. n is the number of letters in the pattern.
- When j=1,wesetitoT[j-1]whichis-1.
- This means that the previous position was not a part of a suffix that matches the prefix of the pattern.
- In this case, all is left is to see whether this character matches the start of the pattern. Since the character is not 'A', then T[1] is set to -1.
- We compare pat[j] and pat[i+1], and if they are the same character we set T[j] = i+1. Otherwise T[j] = -1.

<img width="386" alt="image-20211003142743476" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751899-77d7eb3e-635d-47d3-893f-9cd9d93b7c30.png">

- T[2] also becomes -1 based on the same logic.

<img width="386" alt="image-20211003142735753" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751931-d7a6b430-f4ad-419b-9050-78311b56a65b.png">

- T[3] also becomes -1 based on the same logic.

<img width="386" alt="image-20211003142757242" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751938-421ca511-e118-43f4-b52e-2b69c506cb51.png">

- Now for T[4], i is also set to -1 because T[3] = -1.
- However, since pat[j] == pat[i+1], we set T[j] = i+1. Thus T[4] becomes 0.
- We can think of this 0 as: "the suffix matches the prefix up to index 0".

<img width="386" alt="image-20211003142810253" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751943-eeb12560-a27f-4f54-ba34-a5a759097019.png">

- Now we go to j=5 which is'B'.

- In this case, i = T[4] = 0, which means before this character there is a suffix that matches the prefix up to index 0.
- So we check if current letter matches index 1. In this case, it does!
- Since pat[j] == pat[i+1], we set T[5] to be i+1 which is 1.

<img width="386" alt="image-20211003143002475" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751948-a2bb292e-cb68-4944-887a-e15af8cbc33e.png">



- Now we go to j=6 which is 'D'.
- In this case, i = T[5] = 1, which means before this character there is a suffix that matches the prefix up to index 1.
- So we check if current letter matches index 2. In this case, it does not.
- Then, we update i to be T[i]. This is basically looking for a previous 'AB' sequence. Updating i is done repeatedly using a while loop.
- Since T[1] = -1, i becomes -1.
- Then, we check whether pat[j] == pat[i+1]. Since they are not equal, T[6] becomes -1.

<img width="386" alt="image-20211003143053815" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751954-df28ebd1-75d4-472e-b8a1-7a656b56ebfc.png">

- Now we have the failure function for the pattern. 
- We will use this information to do pattern matching.

<img width="399" alt="image-20211003143119077" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751962-9e764ced-6321-4f71-8c18-6ce15c578a7d.png">

 - In the first iteration, a mismatch occurs at the fourth character (index 3).

<img width="399" alt="image-20211003143133856" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751964-283caf38-e39d-4ea9-b08d-0ffb7f6c7a58.png">

- Then, we just move the blue arrow to index 3. (blue moves along with green.) 
- The green arrow will be set to T[j-1] + 1. In this case, it is 0.

<img width="399" alt="image-20211003143258371" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751970-11e34469-dcc4-4a5f-b807-fb955f2e0cf4.png">

- In the following iteration, since the first characters do not match ('F' ≠ 'A'), we just move the blue arrow one position.

<img width="399" alt="image-20211003143316522" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751974-28bd5cfd-8cc2-4327-8740-85450d9e8fff.png">

- In the next iteration, the mismatch occurs at the last character.

<img width="399" alt="image-20211003143328961" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751982-67eac9d1-3c05-43f7-889a-1a1a2572b0ba.png">

- In this case, T[j-1] = 1. Thus, i becomes 10 and j becomes 2.

<img width="399" alt="image-20211003143342749" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751985-c04b6553-43dd-4c21-bdb0-3560ff9bcb87.png">

- We continue, until the string ends or we find a match. 
- We know we have found a match if j = strlen(pattern).

<img width="420" alt="image-20211003143402296" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751990-5d488e38-26bd-4f88-9e76-71c2afb6dbda.png">

#### Program 2.14 [ex017]

 - We need to run function "fail" first in order to obtain failure[].

<script src="https://gist.github.com/underthelights/d9057aca4d051dc3c6eca65b63b1266e.js"></script>

- Time complexity of running pmatch: O(m), m: strlen(string).
  - Inside the while loop, i is always incremented and does not go back.
  - The function ends when i reaches strlen(string).

#### Program 2.15

<script src="https://gist.github.com/underthelights/77acd18bddebfb5718cd754b70974aaf.js"></script>

- Time complexity of running fail: O(n), n: strlen(pattern).
  - The for loop is iterated n-1 times, and j is never incremented inside the loop.
  - In each iteration of the while loop, the value of i decreases.
  - The variable i is reset at the beginning of each iteration of the for loop.
  - i is either reset to -1, or it is reset to a value 1 greater than its terminal value on the previous iteration.
  - Since the for loop is iterated only n-1 times, the value of i has a total increment of at most n-1.
  - Hence, it cannot be decremented more than n-1 times.
  - Consequently, the while loop is iterated at most n-1 times over the whole algorithm.
  
- Time complexity for running the KMP algorithm
  - Time for calling fail(): O(n)
  - Time for calling pmatch(): O(m)
  - Thus, the total time complexity is O(m+n). It is much smaller than O(mn).

### Try-It-Yourself

 - Try building up the failure function (T) for the following pattern.

```pseudocode
Pattern: A  B  A  A  B  A  B  A  A  A  B  A
```
