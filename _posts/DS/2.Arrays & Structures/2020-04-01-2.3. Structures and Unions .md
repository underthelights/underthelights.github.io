## Structures and Unions (Chapter 2.3)

### 2.3.1 Structures

- A structure (called a record in many other programming languages) is a collection of data items, where each item is identified by its type and name.
- For example, the following declaration creates a variable whose name is "person" with three fields.

```c
struct {
  char name[10];
  int age;
  float salary;
} person;
```

- The structure member operator . is used to select a particular member of the structure.

```c
strcpy(person.name, "james");
person.age = 10;
person.salary = 35000;
```


 - We can create a new structure data type by using the typedef statement.

```c
typedef struct {
  char name[10];
  int age;
  float salary;
} humanBeing;
```

- Then we can declare variables of this type.

```c
humanBeing person1, person2;
```

#### Program 2.4 [ex006]

<script src="https://gist.github.com/underthelights/455d5559c6d5d2121304f5393e1f13c1.js"></script>

- It is possible to use a structure data type as a member of another structure.

```c
typedef struct {
    int month;
    int day;
    int year;
} date;
typedef struct {
    char name[10];
    int age;
    float salary;
    date dob;
} humanBeing;
```

```c
person1.dob.month = 2;
person1.dob.day = 11;
person1.dob.year = 1944;
```



### 2.3.2 Unions [ex007]

- Fields that share memory space; only one field of union is active at any given time.

### 2.3.3 Internal Implementation of Structures

- In most cases we do not need to be concerned with exactly how the C compiler will store the fields of structure in memory.
- Generally, the values will be stored in the order specified in the structure definition.



### 2.3.4 Self-Referential Structures

- A self-referential structure is one in which one or more of its components is a pointer to itself.

```c
typedef struct {
    char data;
    list *link;
} list;

list item1, item2, item3;
item1.data = 'a';
item2.data = 'b';
item3.data = 'c';
item1.link = item2.link = item3.link = NULL;
item1.link = &item2;
item2.link = &item3;
```



### Notes on struct

- This is a clarification slide for using struct in C.
- A formal way to define a struct type.
  - The following code will define a new type called "struct person".

```c
struct person {
  char name[10];
  int age;
  float salary;
};
```

- This is how you declare variables of type struct person. struct person p1, p2;

```c
struct person p1, p2;
```

- You can rename "struct person" to another name such as "humanBeing" using typedef.

```c
typedef struct person humanBeing;
humanBeing p1, p2;
```

- You can directly declare a variable of a struct type without naming the type. 
  - In this case, you cannot reuse the type because the type does not have a name.

```c
struct {
  char name[10];
  int age;
  float salary;
} p1, p2;
```

- You can directly typedef a struct type without naming the type.

```c
typedef struct {
  char name[10];
  int age;
  float salary;
} humanBeing;
```



- In order to define a self-referential struct, you need to name the struct type.

```c
struct list {
  char data;
  struct list *link;
};
```

- If you are compiling with a C++ compiler, you can omit "struct" when declaring variables. (You need to use keyword struct when defining the type.)

```c
struct list {
  char data;
  struct list *link;
};
```
