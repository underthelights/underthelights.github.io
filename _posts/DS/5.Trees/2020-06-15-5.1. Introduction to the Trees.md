## Introduction to the Trees(Chapter 5.1)

### 5.1.1 Terminology

- The tree data structure - Used to organize data in a hierarchical manner

- Example : ancestry of European languages

#### Definition

- A **tree** is a finite set of one or more nodes such that :

  - There is a specially designated node called the **root**.

  - The remaining nodes are partitioned into n≥0 disjoint sets $T1, T2, ... Tn,$ where each of these sets is a tree.
  
    - We call $T1, T2, ..., Tn$ the **subtrees** of the root.

- An example tree

#### Terms

- A node is a basic unit of a tree.A node contains dataand also may link to other nodes.

- The example tree has 13 nodes.

- node A is the root node.

- A degree of a node is the number of subtrees of the node.
- A degree of a tree is the maximum degree of the nodes in the tree.
  - degree of the example tree : 3

- A node with degree zero is a leaf or terminal node.

  - leaf nodes : $K, L, F, G, M, I, J$

- A node that has subtrees is the parent of the roots of the subtrees, and the roots of the subtrees are the children of the node.
  - Node A is a parent node of B, C, and D.Nodes B, C, and D are children of node A.

- Children of the same parent are called siblings.

  - Nodes $B, C,$ and $D$ are siblings.

- The level of a node
  - Root node is level 1.
  - For all other nodes, the level of a node is one plus its parent node's level.

- The height or depth of a tree is the maximum level of any node in the tree.

  - The depth(or height) of this tree is $4$.

### 5.1.2 Representation of Trees

- Representing tree as a generalized list

  - We can represent a tree as a list in which each of the subtress is also a list.

  - Example

    $(A(B(E(K, L), F), C(G), (D(H(M), I, J)))$

    <img width="475" alt="image-20211002225138118" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752409-13856116-6d87-4876-8953-d755cfb84160.png">

- Direct representation

  - We can directly represent a tree by letting each node have multiple links to its children.

  - A node needs to have k links, where k is the degree of the tree.

    - Significant waste of memory

- Left Child - Right Sibling Representation

  - We limit the number of links per node to 2.

  - Every node has only one leftmost child and one closest right sibling.

    - The order of children may be arbitrary.

- Representing a tree as a degree - two tree

  - Simply rotate the right - sibling pointers in a left child - right sibling tree clockwise by $45$ degree
